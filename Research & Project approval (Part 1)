Framework Decisions

Frontend Framework - React vs. Vue.js:
React: Chosen for its robustness, large community support, and flexibility in building complex UIs.
Vue.js: Simpler and easier to integrate but lacks some advanced features of React.
Backend Framework - Django vs. Flask:
Django: Structured and feature-rich, ideal for larger projects.
Flask: Lightweight and flexible, allowing more control and customization for smaller projects.
Challenge Statement

Problem Statement:

The project is a portfolio e-commerce website that showcases my full-stack development skills, covering frontend design, backend logic, and database management.
Limitations:

While the project demonstrates technical skills, it doesn’t address the scalability, security, and performance challenges of large-scale e-commerce platforms.
Target Audience:

This project is primarily for showcasing my skills to potential employers, recruiters, or clients.
Relevance to Locale:

The project can be adapted globally with potential localization for language, currency, and shipping options.
Risks

Technical Risks:

Integration Issues: Regular testing and version control will mitigate potential frontend-backend integration issues.
Scalability Concerns: Architecture designed with scalability in mind, using cloud-based services.
Non-Technical Risks:

Scope Creep: Clear objectives and regular reviews to avoid feature creep.
Team Dynamics: Open communication and realistic expectations to maintain productivity.
Infrastructure

Branching and Merging Process:

Adopting GitFlow, using feature branches, and merging into the main development and master branches.
Deployment Strategy:

Continuous deployment using platforms like Heroku or Netlify, automating the deployment process.
Data Population:

Initially using sample data, later integrating with third-party APIs or a CMS for realistic content.
Testing Tools and Automation:

Automated testing using Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, and CI platforms like Travis CI or GitHub Actions.
Existing Solutions

Shopify: Comprehensive with extensive features, but less customizable.
WooCommerce: WordPress-dependent, whereas my project is standalone.
Magento: Robust and scalable, but my project focuses on simplicity and ease of development.
Reimplementation Decision

Building my own e-commerce website allows for:

Learning Purposes: Hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of the technologies.
Customization: Full control over development, tailored to specific learning goals.
Scalability: A focus on simplicity while retaining essential functionality for beginners.
